# DSPy Use Cases

We often get questions like "How are people using DSPy in practice?", like in production or for research. This list was created to collect a few pointers and to encourage others in the community to add their own work below.

This list is ever expanding and highly incomplete (WIP)! We'll be adding a bunch more. If you would like to add your product or research to this list, please make a PR.
